This repository contains code for simple projects I am using to learn Python.
The projects are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making them suitable for beginners who want to learn Python programming.
The projects cover a range of topics, including:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and modules
